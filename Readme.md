# FitHealth-Your Health Is Our Priority

This is a full-stack health suggestion application built using the MERN stack. The project features a modern UI/UX designed to be user-friendly and accessible to everyone and to every screen width. By leveraging **Google's Gemini Pro AI**, the app provides intelligent health recommendations tailored to user input.
## Inspiration
Our inspiration for FitHealth stemmed from a desire to help those who may not have easy access to healthcare. We recognized that frequent visits to doctors aren't always feasible for everyone, whether due to time, cost, or location. By harnessing the power of AI, a rapidly advancing technology, we aimed to create a solution that could provide accessible, reliable health suggestions to people right from their homes. Our goal is to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility and empower individuals to take control of their well-being.

## Inspiration

We want to help people who are not able to visit Doctors every now and then.We also want to use the trending technology which is AI to use for the people.


## Tech Stack
It is a full Stack project.

**Client:** Vite tool, React, TailwindCSS, EmailJs

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDb

**AI:** Gemini Pro 

## Process

Our development process began with designing a modern and intuitive user interface. The goal was to ensure that the application would be easy to navigate for users of all backgrounds. After finalizing the UI/UX design, we moved on to developing the client and server sides of the application.

During this journey, we deepened our understanding of the following technologies:

* Vite: A fast build tool for React, enhancing development speed.
* React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* EmailJs: A service for sending emails directly from the client-side.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
* Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
* Google's Gemini Pro AI: An advanced AI model that powers the intelligent health suggestions in our app.

Integrating Google's Gemini Pro AI was a crucial step in our project. This AI enhances the application by providing users with personalized health recommendations, making the app not just functional but also highly valuable.


## Challenges Faced

Our biggest challenge was integrating the AI into our website and ensuring that it provided users with a seamless and intuitive environment to interact with. This involved not only the technical aspects of embedding the AI but also designing an interface that made the AI's capabilities accessible and valuable to users.
